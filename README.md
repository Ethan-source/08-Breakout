# 08-Breakout
This project is the product of the culmination of my knowledge regarding the Godot engine, and what we have here is a rudimentary level of Brick Breaker. Throughout the process of creating this project, I have learned the fundementals of Nodes, and how the structure of nodes builds layers of a game. This project was tricker than most, as I had to use my intuition in order to gather the correct sprites that would allow this game to look the way it does. After finishing this project, I now am familiar with the tools of Godot and have basic understanding of what I am capable of doing within the engine.
